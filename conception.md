# Feature Conception: MCP Toolbox

## 1. What is the core problem this feature solves for the user?
The user needs a versatile, containerized set of common utility tools accessible via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This avoids the need to create, deploy, and manage separate MCP servers for each individual tool.

## 2. Who is the target user for this feature?
The primary user is a developer (the user) interacting with an LLM client (Cline) who needs to perform common, simple tasks like testing connectivity, getting the current time, or performing basic data manipulation.

## 3. What is the primary goal of this feature?
To create a single, unified MCP server that provides a collection of simple, reliable, and easy-to-use tools, similar in concept to the BusyBox utility.

## 4. Are there any existing systems or workflows this feature will interact with?
*   **Cline:** The LLM client that will consume the tools.
*   **Docker & Docker Compose:** The containerization and orchestration environment where the server will run.
*   **MCP SDK:** The underlying protocol and libraries used for communication.

## 5. Are there any known constraints or requirements (technical or otherwise)?
*   Must be implemented in Node.js and TypeScript.
*   Must be containerized using Docker.
*   Must use the legacy SSE transport to be compatible with the current Cline client.
*   The initial implementation will be based on the successful architecture of the `sleep-mcp-container`.

## 6. What are the key metrics that will define this feature's success?
*   The server builds successfully and runs in its container.
*   The Cline client can successfully connect to the server and see the list of available tools.
*   Each implemented tool (initially Echo and Time) can be called successfully and returns the expected output.

## 7. What is explicitly out of scope for this version?
*   Any tools other than **Echo** and **Time**.
*   Complex authentication or authorization mechanisms.
*   Persistence or state management between tool calls.
